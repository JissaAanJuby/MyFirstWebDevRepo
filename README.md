# 🍔 Web App Button Designs – My First Web Dev Repo

This repository showcases a variety of "Order Now" or call-to-action buttons inspired by popular platforms like **Zomato**, **Uber Eats**, **LinkedIn**, and more. It’s part of my learning journey in HTML and CSS, focused on creating visually appealing and responsive UI components.

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice HTML & CSS styling
- Recreate real-world buttons from popular apps
- Learn about layout, colors, shadows, and hover effects
- Build a foundation in web design, one component at a time
